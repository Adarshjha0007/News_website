                    <p><strong>Ranchi:</strong> The Congress on Thursday said it has sequestered its MLAs in Jharkhand to stop the BJP from
                        carrying out ‘horse-trading’. Congress party's in-charge for Jharkhand, Ghulam Ahmad Mir said its MLAs had
                        been taken to a safe place because the governor delayed
                        Champai Soren's swearing-in ceremony despite getting the letter of support.</p>

                    <h2>Opposition MLA in Kerala demands caste census in state</h2>
                    <p>An opposition MLA in Kerala has demanded that a caste survey be conducted in the state. 
                        The MLA raised the demand while addressing the ongoing Assembly session. The issue of a 
                        caste census has dominated the political sphere since Bihar made public its caste-based 
                        survey in October 2023.While addressing the session, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) 
                        MLA MK Muneer said, "According to the 105 Constitutional Amendment Act, the state can 
                        carry out the socio-economic caste census. But the state government has said that they 
                        are waiting for the Centre’s caste census."</p>
